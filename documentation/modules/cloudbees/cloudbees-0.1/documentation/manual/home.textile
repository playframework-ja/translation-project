h1. CloudBees RUN@cloud Deployment

CloudBees RUN@cLoud is a cloud hosting service for Java/JVM applications. While it is possible to run a Play application on CloudBees without the help of this module, using it will automate some of the tasks you have to do to deploy on CloudBees.

h2. <a>Usage</a>

Create your application with CloudBees RUN@cloud support:

bc. play new appname --with=cloudbees

You can also add CloudBees RUN@cloud support for an existing application by editing application.conf:

bc. module.cloudbees=${play.path}/modules/cloudbees

h2. <a>Database</a>

If you included CloudBees support when you created your application, the file application.conf contains sample parameters for the database settings. Otherwise, here is how you configure it:

bc. db=java:/comp/env/jdbc/yourProject
db.url=jdbc:stax://yourDataBaseName
db.driver=com.staxnet.jdbc.Driver
db.user=login
db.pass=password
jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect

h1. <a>Deployment</a>

To deploy to CloudBees RUN@cloud run

bc. play bees:app:deploy appname --key your apikey --secret your secret \
	--app-domain your account name
	--app-name name to deploy under

	
To make it easier to deploy, those fields can be put in the projects application.conf file

bc. bees.key=your apikey
bees.secret=your secret
bees.domain=your domain
bees.name=your app name
