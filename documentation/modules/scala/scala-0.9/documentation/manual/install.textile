h1. Installation guide

h2. Prerequisites

Before installing the Play Scala module, be sure to have a working installation of Play framework. Play Scala require *Play 1.2*.

p(note). You don't need to already have Scala installed on your computer. The Play Scala module comes with all required libraries and with the Scala compiler. 
 
The included Scala version is **2.8.1**.

h2. Installing the Scala module locally

The simpler way to work with Play and Scala is to download and install the Scala module locally. You can use the @play install scala@ command to do that:

bc. $ play install scala
~        _            _ 
~  _ __ | | __ _ _  _| |
~ | '_ \| |/ _' | || |_|
~ |  __/|_|\____|\__ (_)
~ |_|            |__/   
~
~ play! 1.2, http://www.playframework.org
~
~ Will install scala-0.9
~ This module is compatible with: Play 1.2
~ Do you want to install this version (y/n)? y

~
~ Module scala-0.9 is installed!

h2. Creating a new Scala application

Now that you have the Scala module locally installed, you can ask Play to create a new application with the Scala module enabled. Use the @play new --with scala@ command for that.

p(note). The **--with** option of the **play new** command allow to automatically configure a set of locally installed module during application creation.

bc. $ play new myScalaApp --with scala
~        _            _ 
~  _ __ | | __ _ _  _| |
~ | '_ \| |/ _' | || |_|
~ |  __/|_|\____|\__ (_)
~ |_|            |__/   
~
~ play! 1.2, http://www.playframework.org
~
~ The new application will be created in ~/myScalaApp
~ What is the application name? [myScalaApp] 
~
~ Resolving dependencies using ~/myScalaApp/conf/dependencies.yml,
~
~ 	play->scala 0.9 (from playLocalModules)
~
~ Installing resolved dependencies,
~
~ 	modules/scala-0.9 -> ~/play/1.2/modules/scala-0.9
~
~ OK, the application is created.
~ Start it with : play run myScalaApp
~ Have fun!
~

As you see, the **conf/dependencies.yml** dependencies configuration file is automatically configured with the Scala dependency:

bc. # Application dependencies
 
require:
    - play
    - play -> scala 0.9

h2. Starting a Scala application

Like for any other Play application, you simply start your newly created application by typing @play run@:

bc. $ play run myScalaApp
~        _            _ 
~  _ __ | | __ _ _  _| |
~ | '_ \| |/ _' | || |_|
~ |  __/|_|\____|\__ (_)
~ |_|            |__/   
~
~ play! 1.2, http://www.playframework.org
~
~ Ctrl+C to stop
~

Now that you have successfully enabled Scala support for your Play installation you can start by creating %(next)"your first application":hello-world%.

Have fun!
